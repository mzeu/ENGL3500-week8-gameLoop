## Skills

* Booleans
* Boolean Operators
* If statements
* Else
* Else If
* LERPing

## Level

The repo has Five Learning Units. The units work thusly:

* The solutions should be deducible from information on the slides. You do not need to google anything extraneous to the slides.
* If a unit has a script in its "Scripts" folder (e.g. "Unit01/Scripts/MoveThenStop.cs"), then you need to fix that script. The script will have DIRECTIONS inside it, in comments.
* If a unit DOES NOT have a script, then you need to fix something in the Scene. You will need to figure out how it SHOULD work based on which scripts are used.
* You need to solve these units sequentially-- don't skip around, because later units depend on working scripts from early units.
* If you get stuck for more than 15 minutes, raise a hand!

## Boss

No boss challenges this week. Instead, pick two games we've played thus far and do a graphical sketch of their Game Loops like what we did in class.

Then start a sketch of your game's loop(s).
